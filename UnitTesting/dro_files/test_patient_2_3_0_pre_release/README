This dataset has been generated by ASLDRO, software that can generate digital reference
objects for Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) MRI.

It creates synthetic raw ASL data according to set acquisition and data format parameters, based
on input ground truth maps for:

* Perfusion rate
* Transit time
* Intrinsic MRI parameters: M0, T1, T2, T2\*
* Tissue segmentation (defined as a single tissue type per voxel)
